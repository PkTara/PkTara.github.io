1: Routine (striking a stationary target, convinging a loyal friend to help you)
2: Straightforward (seducing someone who's already in the mood, intimidating a weakling)
3: Moderate (replacing a car's sound system, walking a tightrope)
4: Challenging (locating the source of a whisper, creating a memorable piece of art)
5: Hard (convincing a cop that this isn't your cocaine, rebuilding a wrecked engine block)
6: Very Hard (running across a tightrope while under fire, calming a hostile and violent mob)
7: Nearly Impossible (finding one specific homeless person in Los Angeles in one night, flawlessly reciting a long text in a language you don't speak)
